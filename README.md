# Listmonk MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation for Listmonk, providing programmatic access to newsletter and mailing list management functionality.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Currently implementing the MCP server from scratch.

## Goal

Create an MCP server that enables LLMs and AI assistants to interact with Listmonk instances through the Model Context Protocol. This will allow for:

- Subscriber management (add, remove, update subscribers)
- Mailing list operations (create, manage lists)
- Campaign management (create, send newsletters)
- Analytics and reporting access
- Template and content management

## Architecture

This server will bridge the MCP protocol with Listmonk's REST API, providing a standardized interface for AI models to interact with Listmonk installations.

## Development

Reference materials and analysis are stored in `.local/` directory. See `CLAUDE.md` for development guidelines.
